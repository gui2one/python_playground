1
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:23,000
Where are you from?

2
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:26,800
Speak Common. 
It's the only way to learn it.

3
00:02:29,900 --> 00:02:31,000
When did they take you?

4
00:03:36,500 --> 00:03:39,000
I want to kill the Masters.

5
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:15,000
You heard her!

6
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,500
She said she came to free us!

7
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,400
You're a fool.

8
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:20,750
The Masters are too strong.

9
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:22,600
She will protect us.

10
00:05:23,300 --> 00:05:26,000
She defeated the Masters' Champion.

11
00:05:28,900 --> 00:05:31,000
She has a great army.

12
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:35,000
You want to live the rest of your days in chains?

13
00:05:35,300 --> 00:05:36,500
I want to live.

14
00:05:36,900 --> 00:05:38,800
You saw what they did to those children.

15
00:05:39,100 --> 00:05:42,100
What do you think theyâ€™ll do to us?

16
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:44,900
Iâ€™ve been through two slave revolts, boy.

17
00:05:45,300 --> 00:05:47,300
They always end the same way:

18
00:05:47,500 --> 00:05:51,000
the Masters in power and the slaves dead.

19
00:05:51,300 --> 00:05:53,000
All men must die.

20
00:05:55,900 --> 00:05:58,900
But I promise you,

21
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:04,600
a single day of freedom is worth
more than a lifetime in chains.

22
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Who are you?

23
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:09,000
This one is called Grey Worm.

24
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:13,000
I was taken as a baby by the Masters of Astapor,

25
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:16,200
raised and trained as Unsullied.

26
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:19,000
Now I fight for Daenerys,

27
00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:22,000
the Mother of Dragons

28
00:06:22,300 --> 00:06:24,999
and Breaker of Chains.

29
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:26,500
You are Unsullied?

30
00:06:27,300 --> 00:06:30,100
They taught you how to fight before you could walk.

31
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,000
We are not soldiers!

32
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:34,800
We have no training,

33
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,100
no weapons.

34
00:06:53,900 --> 00:06:57,800
There are three slaves in this city for every Master.

35
00:06:58,600 --> 00:07:01,900
No one can give you your freedom, brothers.

36
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,900
If you want it,

37
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,800
you must take it.
